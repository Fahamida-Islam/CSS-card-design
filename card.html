          <div class="card-body">
            <p>HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images for your Internet browser. 
              Without HTML, a browser would not know how to display text as elements or load images or 
              other elements. HTML also provides a basic structure of the page, upon which Cascading 
              Style Sheets are overlaid to change its appearance.</p>

    <h1>Why CSS ?</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="card-body">
    <p>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, 
      and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as 
      large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with 
      any XML-based markup language </p>

      <h1>Why Javascript?</h1>
    </div>
  
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>While JavaScript is not the only client-side scripting language on the Internet, 
        it was one of the first and it is still the most widely used.js makes responsive 
        design easier. JavaScript has become integral to the Internet experience as developers 
        build increased interaction and complexity into their applications. </p>
